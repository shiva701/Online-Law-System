It was from a safe house, located in Karachi, that Mir guided the assault team that invaded Mumbai. He used a voice-over-internet line and also ordered several hostages to be executed.

He was the elder brother of Dawood Ibrahim, the current gang leader of the D-Company. The rise of Saabir and Dawood in Mumbai's underworld and the sympathetic attitude of the Mumbai police towards them evoked the jealosy and resentment of other established gang members from the Pathan gang that dominated South Mumbai area. Finally the inter-gang rivalry grew to such an extent that Samad Khan, the nephew of Karim Lala and his assistants Amirzada and Alamzeb plotted to kill Saabir and Dawood. On 12 February 1981, they shot dead Saabir at a petrol pump in Prabhadevi.
